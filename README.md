# ClimateScraper
A script for scraping certain data from pogodaiklimat.ru website. I use it for subsequent analysis.

I have written it for my personal use, so it is not documented at all. If you are interested in climatic data and have any questions concerning this script or website (it is entirely in Russian), do not hesitate to ask me anything.
